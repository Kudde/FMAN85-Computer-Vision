# FMAN85-Computer-Vision

## Assignment 1 - Elements of Projective Geometry
In this assignment you will study the basics of projective geometry. You will study the representations of points lines and planes, as well as transformations and camera matrices.

## Assignment 2 - Calibration and DLT
In this assignment you will study camera calibration and the DLT method. You will solve the resection and triangulation problems using DLT and compute inner parameters using RQ factorization. In addition try out SIFT for feature detection/matching.

## Assignment 3 - Epipolar Geometry
In this assignment you study epipolar geometry. You will use the Fundamental matrix and the Essential matrix for simultaneously reconstructing the structure and the camera motion from two images.

## Assignment 4 - Model Fitting
In this assignment you will study model fitting. In particular you will use random sampling consensus RANSAC to robustly fit various models such as planes, homographies and essential matrices.

## Assignment 5 - Local Optimization and Structure from Motion
In this assignment you will study model fitting using optimization.  In particular you will compute the maximal
likelihood solution for a couple of structure and motion problems.
